# Using the Option Schema

Widget Options Schema are a way to defind configuration options that your widget can accept.

To work on this we'll create a Card List Widget.
<pre>
Name: "Card List Simple"
ID: card_list_simple
</pre>
Once you have this open in the widget editor, click the hamburger icon, then "Edit option schema"

Then add these options;
<pre>
| Label  | Name   | Type   | Hint                           |
| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------------------------------ |
| Title  | title  | string | The title for the card list    |
| Table  | table  | string | The table for the query        |
| Filter | filter | string | The filter query string        |
| Fields | fields | string | Comma seperated list of fields | 
</pre>

# Add Simple List Widget to Playground

## Open the Service Portal designer by opening a new tab and going to /$spd.do

## Type in the filter to find Playground. Open the page Playground home

## Add a container, then as 3,9 split grid

## Put the Simple List Widget in the left side.

---

# Configure your instances options

## Click the pencil while hovering over the newly placed widget;

<pre>
| Field  | Value                                         |
| ------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| Title  | Active Incidents                              | 
| Table  | incident                                      |
| Filter | active=true                                   |
| Fields | assigned_to, impact, incident_state, priority |
</pre>

# Using the SP Instance

You will learn how to create an `sp_instance` extension table 
that allows for more types of options and configurability of 
your widgets.

To give a fair comparison, we will create a similar widget. 
But when you configure this widget you will be able to pick a
pre-built view for the list of fields on your cards. If you
already have a VTB card layout, you could just re-use it like 
this:

![](sp_instance.png)

# Create a Table

<pre>
| Field         | Value                   |
| ------------- | ----------------------- | 
| Label         | Card List Instance      |
| Name          | [automatically created] |
| Extends table | Instance with Table     |
| Create Module | false                   |
</pre>

## Then Add a Column (You'll have to goto adv. view)

<pre>
| Field                  | Value     |
| ---------------------- | --------- |
| Type                   | Reference |
| Label                  | View      |
| Name                   | view      |
| Reference              | UI View   |
| Use reference qualifer | Advanced  | 
| Reference Qual         | see below |
</pre>
javascript:"sys_idIN" + new x_snc_reusable_wid.ListViewHelper().getViewsForList(current.table)

---

# Create a Script Incldue for a ref. qualifer

  - Look at this file [ListViewHelper.js](./ListViewHelper.js.txt)
  - Then type it out on your own.  Learn by doing.

# Clone card list widget

1. Open Card List Simple
1. Clone "Card List Simple"
1. Name the new widget "Card List"
1. Submit

---

# Edit Card List widget in platform

The widget editor doesn’t currently offer a way to do this step.

1. Open the new Card List widget using the platform by using the widget properties menu and selecting Open in platform.
1. Ensure the widget name is Card List (If not you must go to [instance]/sp_widget_list.do and select the Card List widget)
1. Set Data Table: Card List Instance<br/>[Screenshot](./setDataTable.png)
1. Set Fields: `Title, Table, View, Filter, Display Field`
1. Option Schema: `[{"hint":"A field that contains a value 1 - 4 to indicate priority.","name":"priority_field","default_value":"priority","label":"Priority Field","type":"string"}]`

# Setting up the widget: HTML Template

  - Then type it out on your own.  Learn by doing.

---

# Add the new card list to a page

  | Field      | Value              |
  | ---------- | ------------------ |
  | Page title | Incident Workspace |
  | Page ID    | iw                 |

  | Priority Field | [use default]     |</pre>
1. Save

# Handling the empty state

## Providing an empty state

When you dropped the card list widget onto
the page using the designer it was nothing
more than a box with an outline. Even editing
the instance options only slightly revealed 
what the widget does. When practical, your 
widgets should provide an empty state and 
tip users off about how to proceed and what it
will look like when it has data.

Using the Demo data field on a widget is good
for previewing a widget in the widget editor 
but won’t work in the designer. This is because 
the demo data is overwritten as soon as there 
is an instance record. Here are a couple of ways 
you can provide an empty state for a good 
experience in the designer.

---

# Show a default title

1. Open the Card List Widget and add the following code 
   to the client script
   ![](default.title.png)
1. Now you can use that function to set an example title 
   in the client script. ![](default.title.replace.png)
1. And replace it with this; ![](default.title.replace.with.png)
---

# If you want an even richer UX

Replace your client script with [this client script](./rich.client.js.txt)

---

# Try it out


1. Open the designer in a new tab /$spd.do
1. Edit the Incident Workspace page
1. Delete the Card List widget from the left column by clicking on the delete button when hovering over the widget. When it asks you to confirm, click Yes.
1. Drag a new instance of the Card List widget from the widget list to the left column again.
1. Now you will see a much better example of the card list before it’s even configured:

You should see something like;

# Embedded widgets and directives

## Small is big

As your widgets become more complex 
you will want to break them up into 
smaller manageable components. Those 
components can then be reused elsewhere 
or just help define the connections 
between parts of your application.

---

# Move the card template to a directive

1. Open the widget Card List in the platform 
   ui by going to /sp_widget_list.do
1. Search for and open Card List
1. Scroll down to the bottom of the widget 
   and find the related list Angular Providers
1. Click New
1. Use these values for the new Angular Provider 
   - Type: Directive
   - Name: workspaceCard
   - Script: [directive.js](directive.js.txt)

Pros:

  Keeps the template close to the directive code
  Allows you to pass in a different template as a scope parameter
  Can be reused without providing an angular template

Cons:

  Template isn’t cached
  Directive can get very large
