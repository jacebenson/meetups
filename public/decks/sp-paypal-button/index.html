# Welcome Servicenow Developer meetup!

# Service Portal Payment Widget 


Update set: <a download href="./ATF Demo Update Set.xml">ATF Demo Update Set.xml</a>

---

# The premise

Create custom widget to allow user to pay for a thing.

- Payment Modal
- REST Integration to Paypal

# Requirements

- Instance
- Paypal account

---

# What Doesn't Rock

- Not yet support for Service Portal

- Quirks still getting worked out

- Managing versioning of the test configurations

- Paradigm shift to having the testing tool be the same tool as what is being tested

    - Upon new release is the testing tool broke or is it the application it’s testing?

    - Running automatically when a new “build” is deployed has to be rethought, as their is no concept of a “build” in ServiceNow


---

# Key Components

- Step Configs

    - Form
    - REST
    - Server
    - Service Catalog

- Tests

- Test Suites

- Scheduling
